## Process Overview
### My approach
- I started off by drawing out my plans on paper so I knew where I wanted what and how the end product should look. I then completed the application with a screen by screen approach where I try to have each screen completed before moving onto the next one.
- When I tested the app on a physical phone I came across some bugs and had to fix them which took ~ 10 minutes

### What took how long
- The most time consuming aspect of the app for me was brushing up on my Java & Android Studio.
- I did have some trouble with creating a custom info window and getting the device's location was confusing at first.
- In total the whole thing took around 7ish hours.

### Limitations
- Currently limited to loading 25 notes both initially and in search, can easily be increased but this is to favour performance for now
- Lots of room for performance improvements (might just be my slow mac idk)
- Add & search buttons overlap directions to marker
- I want to add activity indicators as those are very important in an app
