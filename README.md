# LandmarkRemark
LandmarkRemark is a simple social location sharing app. You can save a note at your location and search for other user's notes and view them.

## Stack
- Java/Android Studio for the main app
- Backendless for the backend

## Resources Used
- API documentation
- Youtube
- Stackoverflow
- Github

## Process Overview
### My approach
- I started off by drawing out my plans on paper so I knew where I wanted what and how the end product should look. I then completed the application with a screen by screen approach where I try to each screen completed before moving onto the next one.

### What took how long
- The most time consuming aspect of the app for me was brushing up on my Java & Android Studio.
- I did have some trouble with creating a custom info window and getting the device's location was confusing at first.

### Limitations
- Currently limited to loading 25 notes both initially and in search, can easily be increased but this is to favour performance for now
- Lots of room for performance improvements (might just be my slow mac idk)
